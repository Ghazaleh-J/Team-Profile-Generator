# Team_Profile-_Generator_OOP-10

## Description:
A Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable.

## Criteria:

* A command-line application that accepts user input & generates an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input

* By clicking on an email address in the HTML, the default email program opens & populates the TO field of the email with the address

* By clicking on the GitHub username, that GitHub profile opens in a new tab

* By startinh the application, the user is prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number

* Then the user is presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team

* By selecting the engineer option, the user is prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu

* By selecting the intern option, the user is prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu

* By selecting the exit option, the HTML is generated.
